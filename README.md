## Rodrigo Benoliel

* ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m an electrical engineer working as researcher on Power Electronics. I'm developing a FPGA based Real Time Simulator, which integrates a Python user interface with the system modelling and VHDL High Level Syntesis. I've recently worked on the analysis and modelling of the national power transmission system as well, by applying data science and graph algorithm with matlab and python. I like to apply my programming and data science skills to have insights and optimize my activities and side projects.
* ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently interested in developing my machine learning and web developing skills, as well as having new experiences in and outside my field.
* ðŸ˜„ I work part time as programming and math teacher to kids and high school students. If you need I can help you as well!
